Course Description:** This course is intended to be a comprehensive
introduction to robotics algorithms for a senior
undergraduate/first-year graduate student. It is a Computer Science
course, and introduces the student to well-known algorithms in making a
simple robot autonomous.

This Fall, the course is modified to follow a flipped classroom model.
To accommodate students with limited programming background and Linux
experience, we will have activities in-class and videotaped lectures.
Students are expected to watch videos at their leisure (before class)
and attend class where there will be quizzes on material relevant to the
various weeks. The in-class activities will be hands on and you will
submit your work at the end of the class via
[AutoLab](https://autolab.cse.buffalo.edu/). There will be six
programming assignments (PA) spread through the semester that will
require longer programming effort from you. All quizzes, in-class
activities and PAs will be graded. There will be no mid-term or finals
in this class.\
**Prerequisite(s):** Engineering Probability, Data Structures, and
Programming in C++/Python/Java. Knowledge of linear algebra is a plus.\
**Credit Hours:** 3 (468)/ 3 (568)\
**Textbooks**\
There are no required textbooks for this class. Material is selected
from a collection of reference books. They include:

5.  Sensing: Range sensing and line fitting algorithms, range histograms

6.  Sensing: Vision, image formation, camera model, perspective
    projection

7.  Sensing: Image processing, SIFT

8.  Sensing: Structure from stereo

9.  Estimation: Probabilistic modeling of robot localization and mapping

10. Estimation: General Bayes' formulation of reasoning under uncertain
    conditions

11. Estimation: Specific formulations of localization and mapping

12. Planning: Given a map, understand how a robot can navigate from a
    location to another location

13. Planning: Randomized algorithms for planning

14. Learning: Reinforcement Learning basics for planning

15. Learning: Deep learning basics for perception

16. Task Allocation: In multi-robot systems, study algorithms that allow
    robots to perform task allocation

17. Applications: Study full multi-robot systems in deployment/research
    that combine all the algorithms learnt in this class and beyond

While this is a reasonable outline, the instructor reserves the right to
change the syllabus as he sees fit. Please check the course site for the
latest changes.\

Grades will be on a curve. From prior experience, I have seen different
performance from the undergraduate (468) and graduate (568) students.
Therefore, for fairness, I'll grade students on two separate curves, one
for graduate students and another for the undergraduate students.

**Course Policies:**

-   **General** **No makeup quizzes or in-class activities will be given
    unless discussed on a per case basis well in advance.**

-   **Grades**

    -   Graded on a curve with B+ roughly being the median.

    -   Grades will be maintained in the myUB course system. Students
        are responsible for tracking their progress by referring to the
        online gradebook and report any discrepancies.

-   **Labs and Assignments**

    -   Students are expected to work **independently**. **Offering**
        and **accepting** solutions from others is an act of
        **plagiarism**, which is a serious offense and **all involved
        parties** will be penalized according to the [Academic Honesty
        Policy](http://undergrad\-catalog.buffalo.edu/policies/course/integrity.html).
        Discussion amongst students is encouraged, but when in doubt,
        direct your questions to the professor, teaching assistant or
        graders.

    -   Unless addressed with the professor well ahead of a deadline,
        late submissions will not be allowed.

-   **Attendance and Absences**

    -   Attendance is expected each class. Participation in class and on
        piazza carries 5% of the grade. Activities and quizzes are
        in-class. The professor will not entertain any grade changes
        toward the end of the course if the student has not participated
        during the semester.

    -   If you have a medical reason for missing class, I will
        **require** a doctor's note. Without clear directions from a
        doctor asking time off for you, I will assume you are able to do
        the class work and attend class.

    -   Students are responsible for all missed work, regardless of the
        reason for absence. It is also the absentee's responsibility to
        get all missing notes or materials.

**Plagiarism Policy:**

-   This course has several programming assignments and in-class
    activities mostly based on the ROS programming environment. We use
    **sophisticated code checkers** to check for code copied from
    assignments from this class as well as submissions from prior
    editions of the class. It is **very improbable** that you will be
    able to fool the code checker.

-   Along the same lines, if you see someone else's code to understand
    the logic, it is probable that our code checker will flag this as
    plagiarized since your code will be influenced by what you saw and
    will look structurally similar.

-   Discussing high-level programming ideas with other students is
    acceptable. However, this is a slippery slope, and the more detailed
    these discussions are and the more they tend toward actual code, the
    more likely the code checker will flag this as plagiarism.

-   Copying snippets of code from online resources (such as
    StackOverflow, GitHub etc) is also considered plagiarism. When you
    are in doubt, please check with the professor for clarity.

**Tentative Course Outline**:

The weekly coverage might change as it depends on the progress of the
class. However, you must keep up with the reading assignments.
