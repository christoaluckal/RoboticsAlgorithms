## Introduction

CSE 468/568: Robotics Algorithms is a first course in Robot Autonomy. You will learn the basics of perception, planning, control and learning and implement them on a prototypical ground vehicle. For this edition of the class, we will use the F1tenth.org environment and car as a test platform. The course will comprise of lectures, quizzes and several programming assignments where you will implement the algorithms learnt in class on this platform.
