## Introduction

CSE 468/568: Robotics Algorithms is a first course in Robot Autonomy. You will learn the basics of perception, planning, control and learning and implement them on a prototypical ground vehicle. For this edition of the class, we will use the F1tenth.org environment and car as a test platform. The course will comprise of lectures, quizzes and several programming assignments where you will implement the algorithms learnt in class on this platform.

## About the Course

The CSE 4/568 course offers an immersive learning experience in the field of robotics and autonomy using the F1tenth platform. With a focus on the F1tenth platform, the course aims to provide a comprehensive overview of robot autonomy, covering various aspects such as perception, estimation, planning, and control. To enhance the classroom experience, the course includes programming assignments, in-class activities, and quizzes. The flipped classroom structure of the course makes it a unique learning experience, where students can learn and participate in hands-on activities and discussions during class time. To assess the practical understanding of the concepts taught in class, exams are replaced with practical evaluations.

The F1tenth platform is an exciting tool that provides an excellent opportunity to learn about robotics and autonomy. It is a unique and innovative tool that offers a comprehensive set of features for autonomous racing. At the end of the course, students can participate in a thrilling racing competition among their peers using the F1tenth platform's photorealistic simulator. This competition offers students an opportunity to apply their newly acquired skills and knowledge and put them to the test in a fun and engaging way.
